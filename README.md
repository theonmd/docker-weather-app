# Dockerized weather app

Ultra simple dockerized weather app, using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Cloud computing class project. 

⚠️ I did not create the App, I just dockerized it, and the original work from Brandon Morelli can be found [here](https://github.com/bmorelli25/simple-nodejs-weather-app/) ⚠️

To pull the image and launch the App on your machine, type the following command in your terminal:

```console
docker run -p 3000:3000 theolgn/weather-app:1.0
```

And then paste this in your web browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
